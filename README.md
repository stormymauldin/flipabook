Repository for EE461L Project Group 8, Spring 2016

FlipABook is a website that UT students can use to arrange meetings to exchange textbooks. One of its primary attributes is
ease of use -- there are not an abundance of extra features to detract from the core functionality of providing a basic
exchange service. Since FlipABook does not facilitate the actual purchasing of the books, there is no risk of financial
liability, and the exclusivity of the service to UT students prevents a large source of possible spam.

This service was created as the final project for EE 461L at UT Austin in Spring 2016 by William Mauldin, Daniel Officewala,
Tye Macon, and Daniel Zhang.
